# Configuration of your team's repository in a local VS Code or similar integrated development environment:
A step-by-step process of how to do this on a command line interface such as Terminal or Git Bash:

1. Create a new repository
2. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
3. Navigate into the cloned repository:
    cd your-repository
4. Create a new branch:
    git checkout -b feature1
5. Make and stage your changes:
    git add .
6. Commit the changes:
    git commit -m "repository configuration in VS Code"
7. Push the changes to your repository:
    git push origin feature1


# Creating a pull request in an integrated development environment:
After you have pushed your changes, you will need to create a pull request in GitHub to propose the changes to the original repository.

Create a Pull Request in VS Code:

1. Click on the source control view icon on the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code, or use the Ctrl+Shift+G keyboard shortcut.
2. Once your changes have been committed and pushed, click on the GitHub icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code. This will bring up the GitHub view.
3. In the GitHub view, click on the + icon next to "Pull Requests". This will start the process of creating a new pull request.
4. In the "Create Pull Request" view, select your feature1 branch in the "Branch" dropdown. Write a title and description for your pull request, then click "Create" to create the pull request.
5. Your pull request is now created! You can click on it in the GitHub view to see more information, or click "Open in GitHub" to view it on the GitHub website.
